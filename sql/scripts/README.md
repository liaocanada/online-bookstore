# SQL DDL scripts
This directory contains all the scripts used to generate the SQL DDLs.

## Usage
`cd ./sql/scripts`
`node generate.js`

## Notes
* The "order" relation in the ER/schema diagrams have been renamed to "storeorder", as "order" is a reserved keyword in SQL. This change is only for the one relation name as well as all references to it.
